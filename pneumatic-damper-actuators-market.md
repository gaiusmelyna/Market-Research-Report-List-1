<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pneumatic damper actuators market is primarily categorized into spring return and non-spring return actuators. Spring return damper actuators utilize a spring mechanism to return the damper to a default position when air pressure is lost, ensuring safety and reliability. In contrast, non-spring return actuators rely solely on pneumatic control to adjust damper positions without a spring mechanism, offering more flexible operation but potentially less fail-safe capability. Both types are essential for precise airflow control in various HVAC applications.</p></p>
